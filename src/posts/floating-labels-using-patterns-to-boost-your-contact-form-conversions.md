> <u>Edit</u>: Since this post was written, I redesigned my website twice ðŸ˜…. So the pattern is not being used anymore (since I don't have a contact form on the website anymore). I believe the content on the post is still relevant and shows a nifty way to implement it, though. Hope it helps you!

Iâ€™ve launched [my website](https://www.juangarcia.design) about two weeks ago and was surprised by the number of inquiries I had received from the contact form at the bottom of my index page.

As a UX Designer, Iâ€™m always seeking for patterns and standards to improve mine and my clientâ€™s conversion rates, and when I first saw Matt D Smithâ€™s <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Float-Label-Form-Interaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating label pattern</a>, I knew I wanted to test it on my website.

The thing is that [my website](https://www.juangarcia.design) took almost three years to release its beta version (because, you know, thereâ€™s always something more important to do rather than personal stuff ðŸ™ˆ), and after two weeks live, my mailbox had received more emails than ever before, and even though I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s only because of the pattern, Iâ€™ve decided to create a post showing the code behind it. Hereâ€™s the pen:

### A bit of background

Floating labels <a href="http://mds.is/float-label-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were born in 2013</a>. Matt D Smith first introduced them on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Float-Label-Form-Interaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this shot</a>, and since then, it had become in one of the most discussed design patterns so far.

To be truly fair, I think both supporters and detractors have exposed valid arguments for and against the use of floating labels. Hereâ€™s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/float-labels-css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Coyierâ€™s opinion</a> on the matter, Brad Frostâ€™s <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/float-label-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pros and cons</a>, one of the <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most bitter critics</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/bymds/are-float-labels-really-that-problematic-after-all-da7ffe7d5417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Smithâ€™s reply</a> to it. Theyâ€™ve all made good points on their assumptions, so Iâ€™ll leave them all the theoretical stuff and focus on the practical side. Letâ€™s dive into it!

#### Howâ€™s my approach built:

I relied on two awesome CSS features to create <a href="https://codepen.io/imjuangarcia/pen/LeoeGw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this pen</a>: Sibling selectors and pseudo-classes. The mix of this underrated yet powerful techniques had created this result:

One of the most common concerns about floating label patterns is that the placeholder becomes the label. Thatâ€™s a <a href="https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201204/the_html5_placeholder_attribute_is_not_a_substitute_for_the_label_element/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">huge usability mistake</a>. The trick here is that the label <em>is not displaced:</em> Itâ€™s visually hidden (using `opacity: 0;` which still makes it readable for screen readers) until you type something on the input: When the placeholder disappears, the label becomes visible. Howâ€™s that possible by using only CSS? Thanks to the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/v/valid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">:valid</a> pseudo-class.

The `:valid` pseudo-class ensures that the label (sibling of the input field) becomes visible <em>only</em> when the input has at least one character, and the placeholder had disappeared. We do so by using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sibling selectors</a> (learn about them in an easy and fun way in <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/basic-css-selectors-explained-with-cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> which explains CSS selectors using cats).

Thereâ€™s only one thing to consider, and itâ€™s validating the input content: the `:valid` pseudo-class is used to check if thereâ€™s content inside the input, but itâ€™s not helpful to determine if what the user had inputted is a valid email, for example. So, the `:valid` pseudo-class should be used with the help of any frontend validation library (in my case, <a href="http://parsleyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsley</a>, but youâ€™re free to use whatever you like) to throw an error if the user had inputted invalid content.
